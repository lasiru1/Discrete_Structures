### Prompt:

Sketch a graph having nodes {1,2,3,4,5}, edges {a,b,c,d,e,f} and functions:  

g(a) = (1,2)  
g(b) = (1,3)  
g(c) = (3,4)  
g(d) = (3,4)  
g(e) = (4,5)  
g(f) = (5,5)

### Prompt:

Using the graph from question #1, answer the following:	
	
a) Find two nodes that are not adjacent  
b) Find a node adjacent to itself  
c) Find a loop  
d) Find two parallel edges  
e) Find the degree of node 3  
f) Find a path of length 5  
g) Find a cycle  
h) Is this graph complete?  
i) Is this graph connected?  
    
### Solution:

```
a) Vertices 2 and 4 are not adjacent.
b) Vertex 5 is adjacent to itself.
c) Edge "f" is a loop.
d) Edges "c" and "d" are parallel.
e) Vertex 3 has a degree of 3.
f) 5, f, 5, f, 5, e, 4, e, 5, f, 5
g) 3, d, 4, c, 3
e) No, the graph is not complete.
f) Yes, the graph is connected.
```
