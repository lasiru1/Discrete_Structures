### Prompt:

Give the function g that is part of the formal definition of the directed graph shown.

### Solution:

g(a) = (1, 2)  
g(b) = (1, 3)  
g(c) = (2, 3)  
g(d) = (2, 2)  


## &#35;2

### Prompt:

Use the graph in the figure to answer the qustions that follow.  
a. Is the graph simple?  
b. Is the graph complete?  
c. Is the graph connected?  
d. Can you find two paths from 3 to 6?  
e. Can you find a cycle?  
f. Can you find an arc whose removal will make the graph acyclic?  
g. Can you find an arc whose removal will make the graph not connected?  

### Solution:

a. Yes, the graph is simple (no loops or parallel arcs).  
b. No, the graph is not complete (vertices 1 and 7 have no joining edges).  
c. Yes, the graph is connected (every vertex is reachable from every other vertex).  
d. Path 1: 3, a_3, 4, a_4, 5, a_6, 6, Path 2: 3, a_5, 5, a_6, 6  
e. Cycle: 3, a_3, 4, a_4, 5, a_5, 3  
f. Yes, removal of arc a_5 will make the graph acyclic.  
g. Yes, removal of arc a_7 will no longer make the graph connected (no path to vertex 7).
