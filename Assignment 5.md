### Solution:

```
a) Let the domain consist of all integers;
   A(x): x is a prime number
   B(x): x has 3 or more whole-number factors
   
   Some integers are prime, and some integers have 3 or more whole-number factors, but the implication is
   false because there is no integer that is both prime and divisible by 3 or more whole-numbers.

b) Let the domain consist of all integers;
   P(x, y): x^2 = y
   
   x = y^2 for all integers x and some integers y.
   x = y^2 for all integers y and some integers x.
   This is a contradiction, therefore false.

c) Let the domain consist of all integers;
   P(x): x is a prime number
   Q(x): x is only divisible by 1 and itself
   
   Every prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
   There are some prime numbers, and all numbers are divisible by 1 and itself. This is a false implication.
   
d) Let the domain consist of all integers;
   A(x): x is a prime number
   
   Everything is not a prime number. This is a false statement.
   Not all integers are prime numbers. This is a true statement.
   Therefore the two statement are not equivalent.
