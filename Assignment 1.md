### Solution:

```
#37:

let A = Value1 < Value2, B = not even;

(A v B)' v (A' ^ B) <=> (A' ^ B') v (A' ^ B)
                    <=> A' ^ (B' v B)
                    <=> A' ^ 1
                    <=> A'
```
```
#38:

let A = F, B = F, and C = T;

then the conditional expression

        (A ^ B)' ^ C
        
will always be true, executing statement1.
```

### Solution:

```
#61:

Percival is a truthteller.
Llewellyn is a liar.

When Percival made the statement, "at least one of us is a liar", it can be translated into a wff:

        T v F
        
which is true. Since truthtellers can only tell the truth, Llewellyn must be a liar.
```
```
#62

Merlin is a truthteller.
Meredith is a truthteller.

Merlin's statement can be translated to the following wff:

        T -> T
        
which is true. Since truthtellers can only tell the truth, Meredith must be a truthteller.
```
```
#63

Rothwold is a truthteller.
Grymlin is a liar.

Rothwold's statement as a wff:

        F v T
        
is true. Because what Rothwold says must be true, Grymlin must not be a truthteller (a liar).
```
```
#64

Gwendolyn is a liar.
Merrilaine is a liar.

Gendolyn's wff:

        F ^ F'
        
results in false, therefore Gendolyn is a liar. Since Gendolyn is a liar, Merilaine is liar, which is the opposite of what he stated because he is a liar.
