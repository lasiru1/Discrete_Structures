## &#35;1

### Prompt:

Prove: If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the product of two perfect squares. Indicate which method of proof you used.

### Solution:

```
Direct Proof:

if n = 25, 100, or 169 -> n is a perfect square and is the product of two perfect squares.

let n = 25, 100, or 169,
let m = √n where m is an integer,
=> m = √25, √100, or √169
=> m = 5, 10, or 13
=> m² = 25, 100, or 169
=> m² = n
=> n is a perfect square and is the product of two perfect squares by the definition of perfect squares.
```

## &#35;2

### Prompt:

Prove: The sum of two odd integers is even. Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus
odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1.

### Solution:

```

### Solution:

```

```

## &#35;4

### Prompt:
